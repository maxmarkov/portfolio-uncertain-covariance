# Optimal portfolio allocation with uncertain covariance matrix

## Abstract 

We explore the portfolio allocation problem involving an uncertain covariance matrix. We calculate the expected value of the Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) utility function, marginalized over a distribution of covariance matrices. We show that marginalization introduces a logarithmic dependence on risk, as opposed to the linear dependence assumed in the mean-variance approach. Additionally, it leads to a decrease in the allocation level for higher uncertainties. Our proposed method extends the mean-variance approach by considering the uncertainty associated with future covariance matrices and expected returns, which is important for practical applications.
